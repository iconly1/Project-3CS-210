Project Summary
The Grocery Tracker is a C++ application designed to assist Corner Grocer with inventory management by analyzing purchase frequencies. By processing a list of purchased items from a text file, the application provides valuable insights into inventory trends, helping the store optimize its layout and stock based on customer buying habits.

Reflections
Strengths of the Project
Efficiency in Data Processing: I implemented a std::map for efficient data tracking and searches, significantly reducing the complexity of operations.
User Interface Design: I focused on creating a simple, intuitive menu-driven interface, making the application accessible to users with varying technical backgrounds.
Opportunities for Enhancement
Code Optimization: Further refactoring could improve readability and performance. For instance, abstracting certain functionalities into separate functions or classes could make the codebase more modular.
Error Handling: Incorporating more robust error handling, especially for file operations and user input, would make the application more secure and reliable.
Feature Expansion: Adding features such as real-time inventory updates or integration with sales data could extend the application's utility.
Challenges and Solutions
Histogram Implementation: Crafting a visually coherent histogram in a console application was challenging. I overcame this by iterating on design ideas and utilizing string manipulation techniques to represent data graphically.
Learning Curve: Grappling with C++'s syntax and standard library was initially daunting. Regular practice, along with resources like Stack Overflow and C++ documentation, proved invaluable.
Transferable Skills
Data Structure Manipulation: Mastery of std::map and other standard library components is a versatile skill applicable across many programming tasks.
Problem-Solving: The methodical approach to breaking down requirements and implementing solutions is a fundamental skill that will benefit future projects and coursework.
Code Maintainability and Adaptability
Readability: I adhered to naming conventions and included comments to clarify complex logic, ensuring that others (or I in the future) can easily understand and modify the code.
Modular Design: By organizing functionality into distinct methods and potentially reusable components, I've laid a foundation that facilitates extension and adaptation of the application to meet new requirements.
Conclusion
This project not only reinforced my understanding of C++ but also honed my problem-solving and design skills. It was a valuable exercise in applying theoretical knowledge to a practical challenge, resulting in a functional tool that addresses a real-world need.
